            Shipping Policy
          </h2>
          <PlaceholderText>
            At trazor, we are committed to delivering your products in a timely
            and efficient manner. Our shipping policy is designed to be
            transparent and easy to understand.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Order Processing:</strong>
            All orders are processed within 1-3 business days (excluding
            weekends and holidays) after receiving your order confirmation
            email. You will receive another notification when your order has
            shipped.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Domestic Shipping (Within India):</strong>
            We offer standard and express shipping options for domestic orders.
            Delivery times typically range from 3-7 business days for standard
            shipping and 1-3 business days for express shipping, depending on
            your location. Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on
            the weight and dimensions of your order and your chosen shipping
            method. Free standard shipping is available for orders over â‚¹999.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>International Shipping:</strong>
            We currently ship to select international destinations.
            International shipping costs and delivery times vary depending on
            the destination country and chosen shipping carrier. Please note
            that international orders may be subject to import duties, taxes,
            and customs processing fees, which are the responsibility of the
            recipient. Estimated delivery for international orders is typically
            7-21 business days.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Potential Delays:</strong>
            While we strive to meet these timelines, please note that high order
            volumes, postal service disruptions, or unforeseen circumstances
            (such as extreme weather) may occasionally cause delays. We
            appreciate your understanding in such situations.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Tracking Your Order:</strong>
            Once your order has shipped, you will receive an email notification
            from us which will include a tracking number you can use to check
            its status. Please allow 48 hours for the tracking information to
            become available.
